## Sandbox Overview
The Sandbox is an area of [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/) that is designed to be a sandbox, meaning a place where we can experiment, play with new technology, and get feedback on ideas. 

## Sandbox Expectations
Sandbox content isn't guaranteed to be kept up-to-date, maintained, or even work :) Content may be deleted or heavily revised at any time. Community contributions and feedback are of course welcome!
