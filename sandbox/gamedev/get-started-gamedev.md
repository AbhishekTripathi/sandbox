# Getting Started wtih Game Development on Azure

Azure services can be used for gaming in many different ways from and with your favorite game development tools and platforms.  Here are some ways to get started depending on the tools you're using and the services you wish to use.

## Game Engines

If you are using an engine like Unity or Unreal, you will want to use our SDKs and plugins which you can find on our [SDKs & Tools page](sdks-tools-gamedev).

## PlayFab
